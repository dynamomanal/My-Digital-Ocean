JobPilot.AI is an intelligent job application automation tool designed to simplify and speed up the tedious process of job searching and applying. It empowers users to find and apply for relevant jobs across multiple platforms — such as LinkedIn, Indeed, GitHub Jobs, and other integrated APIs — with just one click.

Users can enter their professional details once (including CV/resume, skills, experience level, and preferred roles) and let AutoApply.AI handle the rest. The system automatically:

Fetches real-time job listings from multiple sources.

Filters and ranks the most relevant opportunities using AI.

Generates tailored cover letters dynamically based on the job description.

Uploads the user’s CV and applies to the selected jobs automatically.


This automation drastically reduces the time and effort candidates spend on repetitive tasks like job searching, form filling, and uploading the same documents across multiple platforms.

⚙️ Core Features:

🌍 Multi-platform job search integration: LinkedIn, Indeed, GitHub Jobs, and others via public APIs.
