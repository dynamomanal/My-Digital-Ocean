## JobPilot.AI — Automated Job Application Assistant**

**JobPilot.AI** is an intelligent automation platform that streamlines the entire job search and application process. Instead of wasting hours filling repetitive forms, uploading the same CV, and rewriting cover letters, users simply set their preferences — such as job title, skills, location, and experience — and the agent handles everything.

The system searches for relevant openings across **LinkedIn**, **Indeed**, **GitHub Jobs**, **Rozee.pk**, and other integrated APIs, tailors the user’s **CV and cover letter** according to each job’s requirements, and applies automatically. JobPilot.AI makes job hunting as effortless as setting your preferences once and clicking “Apply All.”

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **User Setup:** The user enters their details once (CV, experience, and role preferences).
2. **Job Discovery:** The AI agent fetches job listings in real time via APIs (GitHub Jobs, Indeed, etc.). If APIs fail, it smartly falls back to **dummy data** for demos or offline usage.
3. **AI-Powered Matching:** The system filters and ranks opportunities using AI — analyzing job descriptions to find the best match for the user’s skills.
4. **Smart Personalization:** It dynamically **generates tailored cover letters** and chooses the most suitable CV version for each application.
5. **Automated Application:** The platform applies automatically or on a schedule — turning hours of manual effort into a **one-click experience**.

## 💻 **Tech Stack & Architecture**

JobPilot.AI is built using **TypeScript** and **Mastra Studio**, leveraging **OpenAI’s LLMs** for natural language understanding and content generation.
It uses a **modular agent-tool architecture**:

* 🧠 **AI Agents** handle workflow orchestration — reading job descriptions, analyzing requirements, and making application decisions.
* 🧩 **Tools** like `jobSearchTool` and `applyForJob` execute actions such as fetching listings, generating content, and submitting applications.
* ⚡ **Workflows** coordinate these steps — from job fetching to resume tailoring — ensuring a seamless automation pipeline.
* 🌐 **APIs Integrated:** GitHub Jobs, Rozee.pk, Indeed, and LinkedIn (extendable via future endpoints).
* 🧾 **Fallback Layer:** Uses `dummyJobs` data when live API responses are unavailable, ensuring reliability and smooth demos.
